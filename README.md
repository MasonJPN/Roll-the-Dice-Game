# Roll-the-Dice-Game
"A simple JavaScript dice game where two dice are rolled, and the winner is displayed dynamically. Built with HTML, CSS, and JS DOM manipulation."



A simple, interactive dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where two players roll dice and the game dynamically displays the winner. This project demonstrates my understanding of DOM manipulation, random number generation, event handling, and responsive design.

Demo
Refresh the page or click the “Roll Dice” button to roll the dice and see which player wins.

Features
-Dynamically generates random dice rolls (1–6) for each player.
-Updates the images of the dice in real-time using setAttribute().
-Declares a winner or a draw in the <h1> element dynamically.
-Fully functional button click event handling.
-Responsive layout for a clean, user-friendly experience.

Technologies Used

-HTML5 – Semantic structure and layout.
-CSS3 – Styling, centering elements, and responsive design.
-JavaScript – Core logic including random number generation, DOM manipulation, and event listeners.

How It Works

-Two random numbers between 1 and 6 are generated to simulate dice rolls.
-Dice images are updated based on the random numbers.
-The winner is determined by comparing the two numbers.
-The result is displayed in the <h1> element dynamically.

Lessons Learned
-Great Practice Assignment
-Practiced working with the DOM to manipulate elements in real-time.
-Reinforced the concept of functions, parameters, and scope in JavaScript.
-Learned how to debug DOM and JavaScript logic in VS Code and browser dev tools.
-Improved workflow for connecting JS to HTML and CSS in a clean, modular structure.

Potential Improvements
Add animations for dice rolls. / the pictures lack creativity.

Allow multiple rounds and keep score.

Add sound effects for dice rolls or victory notifications.
